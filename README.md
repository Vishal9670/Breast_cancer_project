#Problem Statement for Breast Cancer Dataset:
The Breast Cancer dataset aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features derived from cell nuclei present in a breast mass. The dataset includes measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness, among others.

Objective: Develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast tumors as either malignant (M) or benign (B) using the provided features.
